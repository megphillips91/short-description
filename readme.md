# Short Description Block

## this is a practice block
Please do not stumble upon this block and try to use it. Some friends and I are playing around with a few things
- format for a social coding meeting
- co-learning to build template blocks
- other silly stuff.

## Notes for my co-coding friends

### Fri Mar 25th
I am getting the block set up to work as follows in preparation for next week.
- on a single product page
- fail on the single product template

Things I changed after our get together
- Pull in the context. This has to be done in block.json. That is how you can get the product/post id from the single product page
- I recreated the block because I jacked it up in our meeting fumbling things around.
